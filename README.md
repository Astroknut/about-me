## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I like the idea of working for startup or small business. I think I could thrive in an agency role. It's important to me that my work have a visible impact on the company I'm working for. I also want to be able to wear metal tshirts to work.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I like frontend and UX work, so something with a combined dev/design role would be perfect. I also like talking to people, and would feel confident leading projects from a manamagent role.
